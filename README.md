# Random quote machine

Get a random quote.

## Add your own quote

All quotes are stored in [`quotes.yaml`](https://github.com/lukadev-0/random-quote-machine/blob/master/quotes.yaml). To add your own quote, at the bottom of the file add a quote with the following format:

```yaml
- name: NAME HERE
  quote: QUOTE HERE
```

And then create a pull request with the changes.
